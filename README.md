# Jack-in-the-Box
Developing the equations of motion for a jack-in-the-box in order to plot and animate the system. Concepts like Euler Lagrange equations, impact update laws, and homogenous rigid body transformations are used to determine these set equations of motion. The expressions are derived and solved numerically using Pythons SymPy and NumPy libraries.
